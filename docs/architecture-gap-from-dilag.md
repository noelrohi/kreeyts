# Architecture Gap Matrix From Dilag

Source reviewed: `/Users/rohi/sandbox/dilag` on 2026-06-24.
Target reviewed: this repo (`kreeyts`).

This matrix compares Kreeyts against Dilag's current desktop architecture. It is a planning document, not a migration checklist to copy every Dilag file. Kreeyts is a simple desktop wrapper for the Higgsfield CLI (`https://higgsfield.ai/cli`), so Dilag is useful only as a reference for Electron bridge shape, IPC seams, docs, and packaging discipline.

## Product Clarification

Kreeyts should wrap the Higgsfield CLI, not copy Dilag's design-studio or Pi-agent functionality. Higgsfield CLI provides login and creative-generation commands such as:

- upstream install command: `npm install -g @higgsfield/cli`; Kreeyts should prefer its pinned bundled CLI and use this only as a fallback concept
- login: `higgsfield auth login`
- command areas: `auth`, `account`, `workspace`, `model`, `generate`, `upload`, `soul-id`, `marketing-studio`, `version`

Useful Kreeyts seams are therefore likely:

- a small renderer-to-main bridge for Higgsfield CLI status and commands
- an Electron main adapter that invokes the `higgsfield` executable, streams output, and opens browser login when needed
- a small app-state module for preferences and recent jobs, if needed
- docs that describe this Higgsfield wrapper model

Out of scope unless explicitly requested: Dilag's Pi runtime, provider/model auth bridge, project/session model, generated HTML screen policy, timeline tree, design skills, and marketing web app.

For the current architecture after follow-up changes, see [architecture.md](./architecture.md).

## Resolution Notes

Resolved foundation gaps:

- Added maintained docs under `docs/`, plus `CONTEXT.md` for Kreeyts-specific domain language.
- Added a small Desktop Bridge product contract around Host App Info.
- Added a shared Electron IPC channel registry and one real IPC domain, `app-info`.
- Added a Higgsfield CLI bridge and Electron Host adapter for bundled-first executable resolution, install/auth/workspace status, sign-in, credit checks, model listing, asset picking/upload, generation, output opening, cancellation, and streamed command output.
- Added desktop CI/release automation and packaged-app auto-update bootstrap.

Still deferred by design:

- project/session models,
- generated artifact policy,
- runtime bootstrap and event stream,
- native menu, zoom, and theme polish.

## Deepening Opportunities

1. **Bridge contract module**
   - **Files:** `packages/desktop-bridge/src/index.ts`, `packages/desktop-bridge/src/types.ts`, `apps/desktop/electron/preload.ts`.
   - **Problem:** The current bridge interface is shallow: it exposes only `platform`, so it does not hide meaningful implementation.
   - **Solution:** When Kreeyts gets its first native capability, make the bridge a product-level module with a small interface and preload/main adapters behind it.
   - **Benefits:** Better leverage for renderer callers and better locality for Electron transport changes.

2. **IPC domain seam**
   - **Files:** `apps/desktop/electron/main.ts`, future `apps/desktop/electron/ipc/*`, future shared channels file.
   - **Problem:** Main process logic has no modular seam yet. Adding features directly to `main.ts` will spread native concerns.
   - **Solution:** Create IPC domain modules as capabilities appear, backed by a shared channel registry.
   - **Benefits:** Keeps native behavior local and makes the bridge interface the test surface.

3. **Data ownership document**
   - **Files:** future `docs/architecture.md`, future `docs/platform.md`.
   - **Problem:** Kreeyts has no documented storage or runtime data boundaries.
   - **Solution:** Before persistence, document app data root, project-owned files, generated files, and migration/fallback rules.
   - **Benefits:** Prevents storage decisions from leaking across renderer, main, and generated-output modules.

4. **Generated artifact policy module**
   - **Files:** future policy module under `packages/desktop-bridge/src` or `apps/desktop/src/lib` depending on consumers.
   - **Problem:** Dilag's generated-screen policy is a deep module; Kreeyts has no equivalent because it has no artifact model yet.
   - **Solution:** If Kreeyts generates files, centralize path rules, validation, and display eligibility in one module.
   - **Benefits:** Strong locality for artifact bugs and high leverage across host, renderer, and tests.
