# Kreeyts

Kreeyts is an early desktop app for creating image and video ad assets with the Higgsfield CLI. It wraps the pinned `@higgsfield/cli` package in an Electron + React interface and streams generation output back into the app.

## Status

This project is **very early**. Expect rough edges, missing persistence, incomplete flows, and frequent changes without migration guarantees.

Kreeyts is public for visibility, but it is **not open to external contributions right now**. Please do not open PRs or issues expecting support. That may change later once the product direction and architecture settle.

## Development

This repo uses Bun.

```bash
bun install
bun --filter @kreeyts/desktop dev
```

Useful checks:

```bash
bun --filter @kreeyts/desktop typecheck
```

## Notes

- Desktop app source lives in `apps/desktop`.
- The Electron host invokes the bundled Higgsfield CLI first, with global CLI fallback only when needed.
- Higgsfield credentials are managed through the CLI and stored in the app's local data area.
